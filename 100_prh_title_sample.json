The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Yiddish is your guide to this unique tongue, whether you're tackling rules of grammar or just throwing around some key phrases so you sound a little less goyish.

Here's an instant-answer resource that takes the guesswork out of supervising other people and helps you master the problems and challenges you'll face as a new supervisor.

Splendidly presented, filled with thoughtful and brilliant intuitive insights.\" &mdash;<i>The New Republic</i></b><br><br>In a remarkable synthesis of words and pictures, Edmund N. Bacon relates historical examples to modern principles of urban planning. He vividly demonstrates how the work of great architects and planners of the past can influence subsequent development and be continued by later generations. <br><br>By illuminating the historical background of urban design, Bacon also shows us the fundamental forces and considerations that determine the form of a great city. Perhaps the most significant of these are simultaneous movement systems&mdash;the paths of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, public and private transportation&mdash;that serve as the dominant organizing force, and Bacon looks at movement systems in cities such as London, Rome, and New York.<br><br>He also stresses the importance of designing open space as well as architectural mass and discusses the impact of space, color, and perspective on the city-dweller. That the centers of cities should and can be pleasant places in which to live, work, and relax is illustrated by such examples as Rotterdam and Stockholm.",

Not only can the reader learn the essential characteristics of every part of the human body, but can refer again to the illustrations of details that will help rectify specific drawing problems.",

Opening with letters written during Steinbeck's early years in California, and closing with a 1968 note written in Sag Herbor, New York, <b>Steinbeck: A Life in Letters</b> reveals the inner thoughts and rough character of this American author as nothing else has and as nothing else ever will.<p>\"The reader will discover as much about the making of a writer and the creative process, as he will about Steinbeck.  And that's a lot.\" &#151;<b>Los Angeles Herald-Examiner</b><p>\"A rewarding book of enduring interest, this becomes a major part of the Steinbeck canon.\" &#151;<b>The Wall Street Journal</b></p></p></p>",

McMurphy swaggers into the mental ward like a blast of fresh air and turns the place upside down, starting a gambling operation, smuggling in wine and women, and egging on the other patients to join him in open rebellion. But McMurphy's revolution against Big Nurse and everything she stands for quickly turns from sport to a fierce power struggle with shattering results.</p><p>With <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i>, Kesey created a work without precedent in American literature, a novel at once comic and tragic that probes the nature of madness and sanity, authority and vitality.

First published in 1942, this classic work is unique in its blend of literary history, criticism, analysis, personal anecdote, and how-to instructions. Sawyer examines storytelling as a folk art and a still-living art, tracing its evolution from the earliest narrative impulses that developed as stories were written down. With simple suggestions, she instructs the reader in the art of storytelling and freeing the creative imagination by disciplining the mind. Sawyer's guide also includes an engaging selection of international stories sure to enchant both children and adults. <b>The Way of the Storyteller</b> also is an invaluable resource with a comprehensive reading and story list.",

        "description": "<b>Friedrich Nietzsche's most accessible and influential philosophical work, misquoted, misrepresented, brilliantly original and enormously influential</b><br><br>Nietzsche was one of the most revolutionary and subversive thinkers in Western philosophy, and Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains his most famous and influential work. It describes how the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman, the human embodiment of divinity, is his successor. Nietzsche's utterance 'God is dead', his insistence that the meaning of life is to be found in purely human terms, and his doctrine of the Superman and the will to power were all later seized upon and unrecognisably twisted by, among others, Nazi intellectuals. With blazing intensity and poetic brilliance, Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be found in religious pieties or meek submission to authority, but in an all-powerful life force: passionate, chaotic and free.",

Life in the northeastern county of T&#8217;an-ch&#8217;eng emerges here as an endless cycle of floods, plagues, crop failures, banditry, and heavy taxation. Against this turbulent background a tenacious tax collector, an irascible farmer, and an unhappy wife act out a poignant drama at whose climax the wife, having run away from her husband, returns to him, only to die at his hands.

Her journey will alter many lives: Lydia, whose crazed husband is confined at Shay Acres; Stanley, the dreaming commercial artist who brings his eager body to her virginal bed; and a ragtag array of artists and poets. Choosing her own way, Mary Agnes taps hidden resources in a gradual process of creative self-discovery realizing triumphantly that \"it was no great sin to be, at last, alone.\"Stylistically original, laced with Howard's characteristic irony and sharp wit, <b>Bridgeport Bus</b> illustrates why \"Maureen Howard belongs on any list of the best American novelist practicing today\" (Robie Maccauley, <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>).",

Rosa tries to uphold her heritage handed on by martyred parents while still carving out a sense of self. Although it is wholly of today, <i>Burger's Daughter</i> can be compared to those 19th century Russian classics that make a certain time and place come alive, and yet stand as universal celebrations of the human spirit. Nadine Gordimer, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature, was born and lives in South Africa.",

The two shots that rang out at Mayerling in the Vienna Woods echo still.<br><br>Frederic Morton, author of the bestselling <b>Rothschilds</b>, deftly tells the haunting story of the Prince and his city, where, in the span of only ten months, \"the Western dream started to go wrong.\"  In Rudolf's Vienna moved other young men with striking intellectual and artistic talents&mdash;and all as frustrated as the Prince.  Among them were: young Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler, Theodor Herzl, Gustav Klimt, and the playwright Arthur Schnitzler, whose <b>La Ronde</b> was the great erotic drama of the fin de siecle.  Morton studies these and other gifted young men, interweaving their fates with that of the doomed Prince and the entire city through to the eve of Easter, just after Rudolf's body is lowered into its permanent sarcophagus and a son named Adolf Hitler is born to Frau Klara Hitler.",

        "description": "This extraordinary autobiographical story, compelling, candid, and deeply personal, plunges us into that tumultuous moment in China out of which the modern People&rsquo;s Republic finally emerged. It is the first time a novelist has ever described that distant world in words that open it up to Western readers in the clearest, most vivid terms.<br> &#160;<br> Shanghai, 1949: we look through the eyes of Guan Ling-ling, a headstrong, idealistic seventeen-year-old. As her family departs for&#160;Hong Kong, Ling-ling boldly chooses to stay, and joins a revolutionary theater group which soon leaves the city to carry out the new reforms in the Chinese countryside. After a scant few weeks&rsquo; preparation, this city-bred schoolgirl suddenly finds herself in one of China&rsquo;s most remote and impoverished areas, a world so far from her own experience that she can barely understand the lives she has been sent to change.<br> &#160;<br> On her very first night in Longxiang (&ldquo;the Dragon&rsquo;s Village&rdquo;), a dusty hamlet far in the northwest, Ling-ling&rsquo;s life is threatened by agents of a defiant landlord. From that moment on , an unrelenting flood of events engulfs her: plot and counterplot, acts of violence, midnight raids, dramatic personal revelations, even glimmers of first love, all set against a canvas of revolutionary upheaval.<br> &#160;<br> Chen carries us on an incredible voyage against China at a critical moment in modern history. No novelist has focused so clearly or so closely on the faces of revolution, or on the physical and social landscapes in which it was played out, from the urbane circles of Shanghai to the parched fields and desolate families in tiny Longxiang. We are wholly involved in Ling-ling&rsquo;s struggle to assume the unfamiliar garb of soldier and teacher, and can recognize in it an adolescent&rsquo;s painful path to maturity.",

Now, in 1938, Francis is back in town and faced with the wife and home he abandoned, roaming the old familiar streets, trying to make peace with the ghosts of the past and present.

A native and longtime resident of Albany, New York, his work moves from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, chronicling family life, the city&rsquo;s netherworld, and its spheres of power&mdash;financial, ethnic, political&mdash;often among the Irish-Americans who dominated the city in this period.

On a red-clay farm in Georgia, he learns all there is to know about cotton-chopping, hog-killing, watermelon-thumping, and mule-handling. School provides a quick course in practical joking, schoolboy crushes, athletic glory, and clandestine sex. But it is Porter&rsquo;s family-- his genteel, patient mother, his swarm of cousins, his snuff-dipping grandmother, and, most of all, his beloved though flawed father--who teaches Porter the painful truths about growing up strong enough to run with the horsemen. <br><br>\"The writing is elegant, reflective, and amused. Mr. Sams is a storyteller sure of his audience . . . gifted with perfect timing.\"--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>\"Remarkable both for its humor and its sustained and detailed picture of a mischievous Southern farmboy&rsquo;s life during the Great Depression.\"--<i>The Washington Post</i>",

        "description": "\"For 20 years Garrett Hardin has been our most hardnosed thinker about ecological problems...<i>Filters Against Folly</i> makes provocative reading.\" -- Michael Crichton <br><br> The ecological problems facing our world present a forum for experts to offer slogans and solutions on all sides of the issue, but leave most of us confused and unsure of the future. In this bracing book, Garrett Hardin offers a plan for clear thinking about these dangers. He shows how the filters of <i>literacy, </i>understanding what words really mean; <i>numeracy,</i> being able to quantify and interpret information; and <i>ecolacy, </i>assessment of complex interactions over time, can allow anyone to make sensible judgments about ecological issues--even in the face of a barrage of confusing expertise. <br><br> \"<i>Filters Against Folly</i> offers an antidote to some of the more perverse and dangerous irrationalities of our time: wishful self-delusion, educated incapacity, and foolhardy optimism...If ever this book were needed, it is needed today.\" -- Lynton K. Caldwell, School of Public Environmental Affairs, Indiana University",

He paints a full and lively canvas...<i>Quinn&rsquo;s Book</i> casts a lovely light, indeed.&rdquo;&mdash;Stephen King</b><br> &#160;<br> From the moment he rescues the beautiful, passionate Maud Fallon from the icy waters of the Hudson one wintry day in 1849, Daniel Quinn, a twelve-year-old orphan, is thrust into a bewildering, adventure-filled journey through the tumult of nineteenth-century America. As he quests after the beguiling and elusive Maud (she&rsquo;s fourteen), Daniel will witness the rise and fall of great dynasties in upstate New York, epochal prize fights, exotic life in the theater, visitations from spirits beyond the grave, horrific battles between Irish immigrants and the \"Know-Nothings,\" the vicious New York draft riots, heroic passages through the Underground Railroad, and the bloody despair of the Civil War.<br> &#160;<br><br><br><br><b>William Kennedy&rsquo;s Albany Cycle</b> of novels reflect what he once described as the fusion of his imagination with a single place. A native and longtime resident of Albany, New York, his work moves from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, chronicling family life, the city&rsquo;s netherworld, and its spheres of power&mdash;financial, ethnic, political&mdash;often among the Irish-Americans who dominated the city in this period. The novels in his cycle include, <i>Legs</i>, <i>Billy Phelan&rsquo;s Greatest Game</i>, <i>Ironweed</i>, <i>Quinn&rsquo;s Book</i>, <i>Very Old Bones</i>, <i>The Flaming Corsage</i>, and <i>Roscoe</i>.",

        "description": "After the Civil War, the building of the transcontinental railroad was the nineteenth century's most transformative event. Beginning in 1842 with a visionary's dream to span the continent with twin bands of iron, <b>Empire Express</b> captures three dramatic decades in which the United States effectively doubled in size, fought three wars, and began to discover a new national identity. From self--made entrepreneurs such as the Union Pacific's <b>Thomas Durant</b> and era--defining figures such as <b>President Lincoln</b> to the thousands of laborers whose backbreaking work made the railroad possible, this extraordinary narrative summons an astonishing array of voices to give new dimension not only to this epic endeavor but also to the culture, political struggles, and social conflicts of an unforgettable period in American history.",

        "description": "The sensational sequel to the bestselling memoir <i>The Basketball Diaries</i><br><br> During the early 1970s, Jim Carroll was a young and rising star in the crazy and creative downtown scene in New York City. He worked at the Factory for Andy Warhol and discussed art, literature, and the cosmos with Robert Smithson, Allen Ginsberg, and Bob Dylan. He spent nights at Max&rsquo;s Kansas City, listening to the Velvet Underground. And he did far too many drugs -- until his survival instinct impelled him to leave New York for a Northern California retreat.<br><br> Intimate and revealing, the episodes in <i>Forced Entries</i>, Carroll&rsquo;s diaries from that period, provide a sometimes hilarious, sometimes frightening glimpse of people who tested the limits of life and sanity.<br><br>\"<i>Forced Entries</i> captures the early-seventies period in New York better than anything I&rsquo;ve read in a long time.\" -- William S.

As Kerewin succumbs to Simon&rsquo;s feral charm, she also falls under the spell of his Maori foster father Joe, who rescued the boy from a shipwreck and now treats him with an unsettling mixture of tenderness and brutality.

She devoured Q&rsquo;s book, and, wanting to read all the books he recommended, began to order them from a small store in London at 84, Charing Cross Road. <br><br>Thus began a correspondence that became an enormously popular book, play, television production, and movie, and that finally led to the trip to England -- and a visit to Q&rsquo;s study -- that she recounts in this exuberant memoir. Hanff pays her debt to her mentor and shares her joyous adventures with her many fans.<br><br> \"Reading Helene Hanff&rsquo;s book is like making a new friend -- a charming, wise, and funny one.\" -- Betty Rollin<br><br> \"A potpourri . . . easy and assured . . . A delightful companion for the odd hour.\" -- <i>San Francisco</i> <i>Chronicle</i><br><br> \"Hanff&rsquo;s charm is such that when she exults . . . we exult right along with her.\" -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>",

        "description": "\"An absolutely unique voice...It would be an impertinence to call these eight delightful concoctions stories&hellip;A virtuoso Mendelssohn of fiction.\" -- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br> &#160;<br> Drawing on American history, literary legend, and folk tale, Angela Carter transports us to that shadowy country between fact and myth in this book of short stories. <br><br>Lizzy Borden, the spinster daughter of a glutton and a compulsive miser, ticks off the hours before a murder. An eighteenth-century whore and pickpocket who runs off to join the Indians tells her story in a voice of bawdy authenticity. Carter immerses us in the worlds of Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Baudelaire, of khans, princesses, and kitchen boys, bringing them to life in prose of seductive richness and perverse wit. <br><br>In <i>The Bloody Chamber</i>, said <i>The New York Times Book Review,</i> Carter rewrote classic fairy tales \"with all her supple and intoxicating bravura.\" In <i>Saints and Strangers, </i>she is just as audacious, and the result is a book of thoroughly contemporary folk tales that belong utterly to Angela Carter.",
